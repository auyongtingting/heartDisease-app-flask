    4. resting blood pressure (trestbps)
    5. serum cholesterol in mg/dl (chol)
    6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (fbs) 
    -- 0 represents < 120 mg/dl 
    -- 1 represents > 120 mg/dl 
    7. resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)
    -- 0 represents normal 
    -- 1 represents having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) 
    -- 2 represents showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria 
    8. maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
    9. exercise induced angina (exang)
